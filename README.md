# Uncertainty Adversarial Robustness

## Quick Tests
TODO: SCRIVERE MEGLIO\

From this colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vVbEmkDVWsgPJMSMEnc_aBqPn6P7YrkG?usp=sharing) it is possible to see the over- and under-confidence attacks in action with a quick snippet of code, visualizing the uncertainty span of any sample on any RobustBench model.

## Reproducing the Experiments
